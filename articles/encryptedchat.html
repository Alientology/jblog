<h2>What's Diffie Saying to Hellman About the Ethics of Telepathy?</h2>
<p>
  While doing my little self-learning exercise, a question popped into my head. Something like “Do we have a right to talk private in public?” An odd question I’ll grant you. It lead me to think about the ethics of the information age, particularly the right to anonymity and private communication. An apt first question would be to ask is then whether or not such rights exist in the first place, and if so, how they can be justified philosophically.

  The emergence of near instant, near global communicatoin has opened up a new ethical sphere that whilst overlapping with the traditional view of public and private domains of exchange and expression, diffuses their borders. It’s such a novel introduction into the world of human doings that its of course unsurprising that the problems it poses have not been pondered by earlier thinkers. Though ethical conciderations such as those provided by J.S Mill or Kant for that matter, are applicable. For instance one could argue that the categorical imperative denies undiscretioned eavesdropping and wiretapping, treating the users of the technological infrastructure as mere means. Which is where the advocates for widespread nonconcenting monotioring of electronic communication would reply that it's done in the interest of personal and state security. An answer leading down the path to ethical infinite regress as it can also be construed as in breach of the CI.

  Of the two, Mill and Kant, Mills utilitarian arguments resonate the strongest. In Mills system the harm principle servers as the lone axiom by which actions are judged ethical or unethical. From the subsequent investigation that follows, he argument most applicable to the question at hand is the argument from desired continued progress, which states that it is evident that hhumanity is an ongoing project, and that betterment relies on an open exchange of ideas and expressions. <q>All silencing of discussion is an admission of infallibility</q>(Mill, On Liberty, p77). What Mill is saying is that we look upon our world and history and ask ourselves if at any point the inhabitans of the period and region could have benefited from at one point eliminating progress. Can hitting the switch and halting further work on the human soul ever be an ethical action? The emperical data as only accrued since Mill wrote in 1869.

  We return to the objection raized that it's in the interest of public good for governments to access the digital records or realtime information of any citizen, and also the ability to decipher any encrypted data held by any citizen. And in varying degrees this is occuring. It can not however, withstand the scrutiny of being evaluated against the harm principle. Would it at any point in history have been wise to hit the off button on the  idea of secrets or of anonymity? They are at <b>present</b> weapons in popular revolutions, can we immagine a time when it could not anymore be needed? The answer to both these questions seems a resounding "No.".
